**Currently seeking Software Engineering Internship opportunities for Summer 2022.**

Hey there! I'm a third year (3B) computer science student at the University of Waterloo. 
I'm mostly interested in Backend Development, Combinatorics/Optimization, and Machine Learning.

Last term at [**Atolio**](https://www.atolio.com/), I worked on simplifying the enterprise search
problem. I worked with **Go**, **Dgraph**, and **ElasticSearch/Search Engine**.

Before that, I worked on developing telecommunication solutions at [**Acentury**](https://www.acentury.ca/).
