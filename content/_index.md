Hey there! I'm a third year computer science student at the University of Waterloo. I'm mostly interested in Backend Development, Social Networks, and Combinatorics + Optimization.

This term, I'll be building software to help tackle the enterprise search problem at [**Atolio**](https://www.atolio.com/). I'm also seeking Software Engineering Internship opportunities for Summer 2022. For recruiters, here's my [resume](/files/allen_gao_resume_2021_09_2.pdf)!

I've previously worked on developing telecommunication solutions at [**Acentury**](https://www.acentury.ca/).
